/* there is a way to change the elements properties
    OBS: IT WORKS ONLY ON THE BROWSER CONSOLE
    by typing
        document.getElementsByTagName('p')[0]
    than you'll see
        an HTML Collection
    declare it into a variable
        var text = document.getElementsByTagName('p')[0]
    than change the color to blue
        text.style.color = 'blue' */
